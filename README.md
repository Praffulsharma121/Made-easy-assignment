# 3 Step Form For Registration
* This project is a 3-step Teacher Registration Form built using React.
* It has a total of 4 components:
* One common component for reusable input fields.
* Three form components, each representing one step of the registration process.
* Each step includes Back and Next buttons (where applicable) to move through the form.
* The final step has a Submit button that sends the form data to the backend.
* Client-side validation is added for email, password, and confirm password fields and password validation for strong password.
* After submitting the form, an alert appears showing whether the form was submitted successfully or displaying the error message received from the API.
